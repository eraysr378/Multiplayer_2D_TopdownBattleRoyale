# Multiplayer 2D Topdown Battle Royale Game
This is my first multiplayer project. I used unity netcode for implementation of the multiplayer system.<br />
The game is a simple battle royale game. Each player gets spawned at a position with a knife on their hand.<br />
When the game starts players seek for loot boxes. There are three types of box. Weapon box, equipment box and ability box.<br />
Each box has its own loot. You can see the contents of the boxes in the pdf. <br />
Also there is a safe zone which shrinks in time and if a player is outside the safe zone then the player starts taking damage. <br />
These are the basics of the game you can check the video for more. <br />
